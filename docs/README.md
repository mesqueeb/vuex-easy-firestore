# Overview

In just 4 lines of code, get your vuex module in complete 2-way sync with firestore:

```js
const userDataModule = {
  firestorePath: 'users/{userId}/data',
  firestoreRefType: 'collection', // or 'doc'
  moduleName: 'userData',
  statePropName: 'docs',
  // the rest of your module here
}
// add userDataModule as vuex plugin wrapped in vuex-easy-firestore
```

and Alakazam! Now you have a vuex module called `userData` with `state: {docs: {}}`.
All firestore documents in your collection will be added with the doc's id as key inside `docs` in your state.

Now you just update and add docs with `dispatch('userData/set', newItem)` and forget about the rest!

# Features

- Automatic 2-way sync between your Vuex module & Firestore
- [Default values](extra-features.html#default-values)
- [Hooks](hooks.html#hooks) (before / after sync)
- [Fillables / guard](extra-features.html#fillables-and-guard) (limit fields which will sync)
- [Timestamp conversion to Date()](extra-features.html#firestore-timestamp-conversion)
- [Where / orderBy clauses](query-data.html#where-orderby-clauses)

# Motivation

I didn't like writing an entire an API wrapper from scratch for firestore every single project. If only a vuex module could be in perfect sync with firestore without having to code all the boilerplate yourself...

And that's how Vuex Easy Firestore was born.
