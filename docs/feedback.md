# Feedback

Do you have questions, comments, suggestions or feedback? Or any feature that's missing that you'd love to have? Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/mesqueeb/vuex-easy-firestore/issues)! ♥

Planned future features:

- Create a YouTube video
- Documentation
  - Add other documentation languages
  - Improve 'patching' documentation for loaders/spinners
- Improve under the hood syntax (consider using `_vuexEasyFirestoreConf` instead of `_conf`)
- Warn when there are props that clash with this library

Also be sure to check out the **sister vuex-plugin** [Vuex Easy Access](https://mesqueeb.github.io/vuex-easy-access)!
